# Sistema de aprendizaje no supervisado para el anÃ¡lisis y control de redes de regulaciÃ³n genÃ©tica ðŸ§¬


## ðŸ§ª Description

An intelligent and automated system for the dynamic analysis and control of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs), built with:

- MATLAB for dynamic modeling and control analysis
- Python for the graphical user interface and data visualization
- FastAPI for building the API that bridges MATLAB and the web app
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for classifying attractors into the observed phenotypes using K-means

## ðŸ§  Features 

- Unsupervised classification of attractors into phenotypes of the biological system under study
- Reachability analysis in networks with <15 genes using Semi-Tensor Product libraries and sparse matrices
- Detection of genes prone to causing phenotypic transitions in the system through bifurcation analysis in complex networks (>15 genes)
- Communication between MATLAB and the app via JSON
- Intuitive graphical interface developed with FastAPI
